0. What problems of metadata change solved?
-----------
1) To make sure there will be no name conflict between field and others(meta data like author, location field like parent_id)
2) To make sure there will be no name conflict between content table table and system tables(eg.dm_location).
3) To make sure rest api has category(metadata, location)
4) More natual to understand, since content is first, location/author is second. The old way was location first.

Important:
After this change id is the real content id(cid before) while location's id is the old 'id'. Then every content has id(in old way id was cid for non-location content).

1. model 
-------
All Entities will have this embed:

contenttype.Metadata:
    Contenttype string    `boil:"_contenttype"
	Name        string    `boil:"_name" 
	Version     int       `boil:"_version"
	Published   time.Time `boil:"_published" 
	Modified    time.Time `boil:"_modified" 
	CUID        string    `boil:"_cuid" 
	Author      int       `boil:"_author"

contenttype.Location

2. database change
table name:
All content tables will be prefixed as dmc_, eg. dmc_article so there will be no conflict with dm_, which is system tables.

field name:
All meta fields uses underline(eg. _author)

dm_location.name will not be used since, it's in metadata.

3. API change
 - old query.FetchByID is replace by query.FetchByLID
 - new query.FetchByID will need contentType parameter


3. rest api change:
article
{
  "title":"Test",
  "id":3,
  "metadata":{
    contenttype: "article",
    name: "Test"
  }
  "location":{
    id: 45,
    parent_id: 4
    ...
  }
}
